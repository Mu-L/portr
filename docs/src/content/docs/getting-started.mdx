Portr is a self-hosted tunnel solution designed for teams. It lets you expose local http/tcp connections to the internet.

You can use the client to quickly tunnel http/tcp connections

```bash
portr http 9000
```

This command exposes your local http server running at port `9000` on a public https url.

Checkout how to quickly create a tunnel and inspect requests using the dashboard in the following video

Here's a quick walk-through of the admin dashboard, where you can monitor connections, create and manage teams and team members.
