<Aside>We'll be creating a Github app and not an Oauth app, because the Github app will be used to manage users for a team(add/remove users)</Aside>

Github app is required for the users to login to the admin server.

For the rest of this guide, we'll assume `example.com` as your domain.

- Go to [https://github.com/settings/apps](https://github.com/settings/apps)

- Enter the callback URL as [https://example.com/api/v1/auth/github/callback](https://example.com/api/v1/auth/github/callback)
